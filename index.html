<p>    The interdisplinary field of materials science, also commonly termed materials science and engineering,
is the deisgn and discovery of new materials, particularly solids.The intellectual origins of materials science stem from
the Emligtenment,when researchers began to use analytical thinking from chemistry,physics, and engineering to understand
ancient, phenomenological observations in metallurgy and mineralogy. Materials science still incorporates elements of
physics,chemistry and engineering.</p>
<p> Materials science is a syncretic discipline hybridizing metallurgy, ceramics, solid-state physics, and chemistry. It is 
the first example of a new academic discipline emerging by fusion rather than fission</p>
<p>Many of the most pressing scientific problems humans currently face are due to the limits of the materials that are available and how they are used. Thus, 
breakthroughs in materials science are likely to affect the future of technology significantly.All the Minerals are obtained form the ores
All the minerals are ores but all the ores are not minerals.
The few ores are in the table given below</p>

<p>Spin Finish Determination on Fiber (FOF), Oil Pick Up (OPU), Avivage
Spin Finish is added to various fiber during production to improve downstream handling. This way, static electricity and sufficient lubrication are effectively avoided and guaranteed, respectively.
Clearly, the amount of Spin Finish has to be tightly controlled. To this end, a bias-free, non-destructive as well as speedy and reliable method is needed. the minispec mq-one Spin Finish Analyzer is the perfect choice meeting these demands and exceeding customer's expectations.

<h2>Alloys</h2>
<hr>
<p>The study of metal alloys is a significant part of materials science. Of all the metallic alloys in use
 today, the alloys of iron (steel, stainless steel, cast iron, tool steel, alloy steels) make up the larges
 t proportion both by quantity and commercial value. Iron alloyed with various proportions of carbon gives
 low, mid and high carbon steels. An iron-carbon alloy is only considered steel if the carbon level is 
 between 0.01% and 2.00%. For the steels, the hardness and tensile strength of the steel is related to the 
 amount of carbon present, with increasing carbon levels also leading to lower ductility and toughness. 
 Heat treatment processes such as quenching and tempering can significantly change these properties, 
 however. Cast Iron is defined as an iron–carbon alloy with more than 2.00% but less than 6.67% carbon. 
 Stainless steel is defined as a regular steel alloy with greater than 10% by weight alloying content of 
 Chromium. Nickel and Molybdenum are typically also found in stainless steels.
Other significant metallic alloys are those of aluminium, titanium, copper and magnesium. Copper alloys 
have been known for a long time (since the Bronze Age), while the alloys of the other three metals have 
been relatively recently developed. Due to the chemical reactivity of these metals, the electrolytic 
extraction processes required were only developed relatively recently. The alloys of aluminium, titanium 
and magnesium are also known and valued for their high strength-to-weight ratios and, in the case of magnesium, 
their ability to provide electromagnetic shielding. These materials are ideal for situations where high strength-to-weight 
ratios are more important than bulk cost, such as in the aerospace industry and certain automotive engineering
 applications.</p>
